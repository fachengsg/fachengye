# Facheng Ye (叶法丞), PhD

**Quantitative marine ecologist & conservation palaeobiologist** working at the interface of **benthic biodiversity, functional traits, palaeontology, biogeography and environmental change**.  
I build **reproducible R/GIS pipelines** that integrate **biodiversity/trait databases** with **gridded ocean–climate products (NetCDF/GeoTIFF)** to quantify community responses to warming and other stressors, and to produce **clear, decision-ready indicators** for research and (where relevant) management.

- 📍 Based in Naples, Italy | Research Fellow @ *Stazione Zoologica Anton Dohrn*  
- 🧪 Background: shell archives (microstructure + isotopes), trait-based ecology, biodiversity informatics  
- 📝 Publications: **21 peer-reviewed papers (10 first-author)**; PhD funded by **Marie Skłodowska-Curie Actions (MSCA)**

## What I do

### Reproducible quantitative ecology (R + GIS)
- Trait-based and community analyses: **functional diversity**, redundancy/turnover, ordination, null models, resampling/CI workflows  
- Trait–environment frameworks: **RLQ / fourth-corner** and related inference for stressor–response questions  
- Reporting: traceable workflows **from raw data → analysis → figures/tables** with clear documentation and versioning

### Environmental & spatial data integration
- Work with **NetCDF/GeoTIFF** climate/ocean datasets; extraction, regridding, QA/QC, metadata handling  
- **QGIS/ArcGIS** mapping, spatial joins, CRS management, raster/vector workflows  
- Database-minded: tidy, well-documented datasets; experience with **SQL/relational thinking** for biodiversity/trait data products

### Shell-based archives (transferable to sclerochronology / carbonate proxy work)
- Carbonate proxies: **δ¹⁸O, δ¹³C, ⁸⁷Sr/⁸⁶Sr** and shell microstructure as environmental signals  
- Imaging & lab workflows: **SEM / EBSD / microscopy**, micro-drilling, carbonate preparation, uncertainty-aware alignment with covariates

## Experience snapshot
- **Research Fellow (2024–present)** — Stazione Zoologica Anton Dohrn (Naples)  
  Trait-based and spatial analyses of modern + fossil Mediterranean invertebrates; reproducible pipelines integrating traits, abundance, and gridded environmental fields.

- **Associate Research Fellow (2019–2023)** — University of Wollongong (Australia)  
  Quantitative biodiversity/trait research; built and maintained large trait & occurrence databases; supported teaching and mentoring.

- **Collections & Outreach Manager (2012–2015)** — Nanjing Museum of Palaeontology, CAS (China)  
  Fossil invertebrate curation & digitisation; databasing workflows; exhibitions and public engagement.

## Featured repositories (pin these)
> I keep my “job-application-ready” projects pinned here. Typical formats:
- **Paper reproducibility**: scripts + documentation to regenerate main results/figures  
- **Methods/toolkits**: reusable functions for trait/community analyses, null models, and CI workflows  
- **Data products**: clean, documented datasets (or instructions to obtain/derive them)

## Open science & collaboration
I enjoy building analysis pipelines that are **transparent, reusable, and friendly to collaborators**—with clear file structure, metadata, and notes for “handover-ready” projects.
